To give you a more specific idea of the path we’ll take, chapter sum-
maries can be found below.
Chapter 1: the importance of context
Before you start down the path of data visualization, there are a
couple of questions that you should be able to concisely answer:
Who is your audience? What do you need them to know or do? This
chapter describes the importance of understanding the situational
context, including the audience, communication mechanism, and
desired tone. A number of concepts are introduced and illustrated
via example to help ensure that context is fully understood. Creating
a robust understanding of the situational context reduces iterations
down the road and sets you on the path to success when it comes
to creating visual content.
Chapter 2: choosing an effective visual
What is the best way to show the data you want to communicate?
I’ve analyzed the visual displays I use most in my work. In this chap-

nicate data in a business setting, discuss appropriate use cases for
each, and illustrate each through real‐world examples. Specific types
of visuals covered include simple text, table, heatmap, line graph,
slopegraph, vertical bar chart, vertical stacked bar chart, waterfall
chart, horizontal bar chart, horizontal stacked bar chart, and square
area graph. We also cover visuals to be avoided, including pie and
donut charts, and discuss reasons for avoiding 3D.

Picture a blank page or a blank screen: every single element you
add to that page or screen takes up cognitive load on the part of
your audience. That means we should take a discerning eye to the
elements we allow on our page or screen and work to identify those
things that are taking up brain power unnecessarily and remove
